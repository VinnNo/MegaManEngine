# __MegaManEngine RE__

Megaman Engine RE (reverse-engineered) is an expirimental engine, built within GameMaker Studio 1.4, to bridge the gap between a carefully designed classic game and modern hardware and code bases. The mechanics in this project are made to best match that found in the original 6502 Assembly codebase (Ripped ROM). Even with using GML, the game works within similar limits found in the NES game EG. Texture Sizes, object counts, careful blends of both preloaded color pallettes and sound quality.

__Features__
  * Book-matched variables and mechanics, found in the original game.
  * All Boss-Powers found in Megaman/Rockman 1-8, plus 
  * A proof-of-concept Boss (PharohMan), complete with a reusable AI system, Boss Intro event and Boss Defeated Event with modular Boss-Power inventory insertion.
  *

This is an expirimental clone of the original Megaman/Rockman game for NES.
Uses physics variables pulled directly from the decompiled ROM, so as to be 
true to the original title, but compatible with a more modern engine.

Gimmicks are conveyors, drop platforms, elevators etc

Includes all boss powers and Rocket (not actually in the original title)
Room transitions with delta scrolling. On/off-screen tracking. Pickup tracking (can't get the same one twice)
Controller support.
