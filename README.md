# MegaManEngine

This is an expirimental clone of the original Megaman/Rockman game for NES.
Uses physics variables pulled directly from the decompiled ROM, so as to be 
true to the original title, but compatible with a more modern engine.

Gimmicks are conveyors, drop platforms, elevators etc

Includes all boss powers and Rocket (not actually in the original title)
Room transitions with delta scrolling. On/off-screen tracking. Pickup tracking (can't get the same one twice)
Controller support.
